<h1 id="web-developerdesigner">Web Developer/Designer</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The Data Transfer Initiative (DTI) is a non-profit tech/policy organization launched in early 2023.  Our mission is to empower people by building a vibrant ecosystem for simple and secure data transfers. Evolving markets and regulations are creating circumstances for significant investments into data portability, supporting increased control and choice for individuals. We collaborate and communicate with our partners (including a growing list of corporate supporters) as well as with regulators, public interest groups, standards organizations and more. We are building, together with our partners, a growing ecosystem of open source software and interconnected portability services.</p>

<h2 id="job-description">Job Description</h2>

<p>The Data Transfer Initiative is seeking a frontend developer and graphic designer, to be a major contributor to our projects supporting data portability rights and interoperability. As an experienced contributor, we will be looking to you for ideas, designs, architecture proposals and execution of major parts of our tech projects. We are currently envisioning this role as a contract employment of between 15 and 30 hours per week, with possible shift to full-time depending on skill fit.</p>

<h3 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Build Web apps and static Web sites;</li>
  <li>Promote accessibility of DTI content and tools and good information design;</li>
  <li>Collaborate in the context of a team where code reviews, unit tests and flexible iteration are standard;</li>
  <li>Assist in the development of plans and wireframes for UX;</li>
  <li>Stay current with leading Web, CSS and JS technologies and able to recommend appropriate tech choices;</li>
  <li>Work from organized issue/feature lists but also contribute to prioritization and scoping of issues and features and developing delivery estimates;</li>
  <li>Maintain our active online sites/pages (this is not expected to be most of the job - most work anticipated is new site/feature development).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="minimum-qualifications">Minimum Qualifications</h3>

<ul>
  <li>3+ years developing usable and professional Web-based UIs and Web sites - adjacent experience (e.g. publishing) could be considered also</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS and JS expertise: able to smoothly integrate these together in maintainable, organized codebase and high-quality site</li>
  <li>Layout expertise and good application of information design principles</li>
  <li>Graphic design skills sufficient to make modifications to SVGs etc, possibly more as we do not have dedicated graphic design resources at present</li>
  <li>Strong ability to work independently, to keep moving even when questions arise, to make (and communicate, and confirm) reasonable assumptions to move forward</li>
  <li>Strong ability to use asynchronous as well as real-time communications to coordinate work closely with team</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="additional-qualifications-or-nice-to-haves">Additional Qualifications or “nice to haves”</h3>

<p>Because we’re a small team and each person wears several hats, what other hats might you be suited to wear occasionally? Let us know if you enjoy stretching any of the following skills or experience</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higher-level graphic design interest and skills</li>
  <li>Interest and aptitude for writing or editing - DTI’s small team writes a biweekly blog</li>
  <li>Experience in small-org marketing in any way</li>
  <li>Python or Django (Django template) knowledge</li>
  <li>Experience managing operations, hosting and related tools appropriate to small orgs</li>
  <li>Java server-side experience</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-work-for-dti">Why work for DTI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We have a great mission! We believe people should not be locked into the platforms where they have contributed data and content by that data being hard to move elsewhere, and we work to support tech policy and interoperability. It’s a meaty topic that we get very technical about because we advise on regulations, security policies, threat models and system architecture.</li>
  <li>Within our mission, we have a great deal of flexibility to grab opportunities and consider new projects, as long as we execute competently and iterate wisely. Your ideas will be welcome.</li>
  <li>Our CTO is an experienced engineering manager who has always supported her employees’ growth and effectiveness. She knows how to build culture and processes within which projects and teams work well.</li>
  <li>We have a great deal of flexibility for timing and conditions of work. We care more about good quality work at a decent pace than about hours worked or where. Pacific TZ is core hours for collaborative work.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="application-process">Application Process</h3>

<p>Please send your resume and optional cover letter to lisa@dtinit.org. In the cover letter, help us understand your story and your superpowers. We believe references and portfolios are better demonstrations of your work abilities than interviews, so feel free to send relevant information  up-front if that works well for you.</p>

<p>After reviewing candidate applications, we will select several qualified folks and request to schedule a couple online video interviews to get to know you and assess fit and interest.</p>

<p>The Data Transfer Initiative provides equal employment opportunity (EEO) to all persons regardless of age, color, national origin, citizenship status, physical or mental disability, race, religion, creed, gender, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, genetic information, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law. We are committed to building a diverse staff and strongly encourage applications from candidates who may be people of color, disabled, gender and sexual minorities, and other disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
