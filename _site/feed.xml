To me, that’s one of those time periods that feels like forever, but at the same time, hardly any time at all. In the same way, it feels like we’ve had some significant wins already – and yet, we’re only just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m happy to share our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/DTI-Annual-Report-2024.pdf&quot;&gt;2024 Annual Report&lt;/a&gt;, which showcases DTI’s accomplishments during our second year of operation. This year we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partnered with Apple and Google to ship new Data Transfer Project (DTP) tools for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/07/10/DTI-members-new-photo-video-tool&quot;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/08/27/DTI-members-new-music-tool&quot;&gt;music playlist&lt;/a&gt; transfers;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Produced multiple original outputs on data portability and trust, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/ThreatModel.pdf&quot;&gt;threat model&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/docs/TrustModelReport.pdf&quot;&gt;trust report&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/docs/TrustModel_Nov2024.pdf&quot;&gt;granular trust model&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launched the first-ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://portmap.dtinit.org/&quot;&gt;Portability Map&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Published an original compendium of independent scholarly research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/DTI-Data-Portability-Compendium.pdf&quot;&gt;The Present and Future of Data Portability&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expanded our impact and built on our prior work in the European Union through key events such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techpolicy.press/reporting-out-on-the-data-transfer-summit-a-day-of-portability-for-a-future-of-empowerment/&quot;&gt;Data Portability Summit&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC and two events in London; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took on new challenges related to Fediverse standards and AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve built a strong substantive and operational foundation at DTI. And now – we’re ready to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in time, I see three dimensions to our growth. The first is &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;. To date, we have worked on building tools, related technical developments, and public policy for data portability. This is a lot to take on already for an organization of our size, but we are strategic and efficient, and in fact we believe there’s even more we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One critical angle that we are excited to build out, in particular, is public engagement. By listening to people’s experiences and feelings about their data and portability options, teaching broader audiences about portability tools, and channeling the signals we receive back to tool developers and regulators, we can refine our technology and policy efforts, and help ensure that users remain at the center of data portability in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second dimension is &lt;em&gt;staff&lt;/em&gt;. In 2024, we didn’t add any new headcount, but now we’re adding two new full-time team members, bringing our total to five, along with a fantastic (though also small!) team of contractors. One of those new roles will lead our public engagement workstream, and for that, I’m delighted to welcome Jen Caltrider as DTI’s Director of Research and Engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second role will establish a presence for us across the Atlantic, allowing us to contribute even more effectively to critical conversations about portability in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Tom Fish will be joining us in a couple weeks as our Head of Europe, reporting into Delara Derakhshani, our Director of Policy and Partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are growing our &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt;, the group of organizations we work with to deliver results. Last year, we welcomed two new partners, ErnieApp and Amazon, who join our founding members Apple, Google, and Meta as core supporters and collaborators to our work at DTI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re always on the lookout for new partners. But for organizations who want to test the waters of portability rather than dive in headfirst with us, we’ve introduced a new category: &lt;em&gt;Affiliates&lt;/em&gt;. Affiliates work with us on specific projects, strategies and processes. Inflection AI has joined as our first affiliate and we’re hopeful to add a few more in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post has focused on DTI and our growth, but I wanted to give context: The world of data portability is expanding rapidly. There is rising awareness of its importance in several markets, along with opportunities to build effective, user-centered solutions that serve people’s needs. More and more people are running events, undertaking initiatives, and holding conversations on data portability. DTI is growing not only because of our strong foundation, but also because the need for our work is growing too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be more excited for the year ahead for DTI, and for the data portability ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand how frustrating the lack of control is over not knowing whether your content will continue to be available. In fact, it’s at the heart of what we do. &lt;strong&gt;Data portability is about giving users control over their digital lives&lt;/strong&gt;. No one should feel trapped or powerless when a platform changes its policies, faces regulatory issues, or shuts down entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, you would be able to keep and move all of the data that is important to you whenever you want and wherever you want, no matter the platform it currently lives on. While we aren’t there yet, we do want to provide you with some helpful resources to help preserve your data as much as possible today — no matter what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTI’s Portability Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about how to transfer your content, with TikTok or any other online service, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://portmap.dtinit.org/&quot;&gt;Portability Map&lt;/a&gt; may help. It’s a resource designed to guide you through the tools available on platforms like TikTok and others, making it easier to download and protect your data. While the Portability Map is in its beginning stages and we don’t consider it to be complete at this time, we are excited to share it with you and look forward to expanding it in the near future. You can access what information Portability Map has about TikTok’s offerings &lt;a href=&quot;https://portmap.dtinit.org/articles/watch-history3.md/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We also encourage you to visit TikTok’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data&quot;&gt;Requesting Your Data&lt;/a&gt;” page, which has additional information on how to download or transfer your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Portability Map is an important part of our larger mission at DTI to be a go-to resource for all things data portability. We see great value in a central hub where users can find resources to move their personal data from one service to another. By building an easy-to-use and informative repository, we strongly believe that we help people not only understand that they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; move their data but also empower them to take action. Additionally, the content within Portability Map is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtinit/portability-articles&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; (as is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtinit/portmap&quot;&gt;its code&lt;/a&gt;, for that matter), and we welcome contributions of suitable articles and resources on portability tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Broader Portability Picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential ban on TikTok is a reminder of how important it is to users to be able to preserve and move their content with data portability tools. Services go down and data becomes inaccessible, sometimes with little warning. Just recently, on December 17th, Mozilla &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248142/mozilla-will-shut-down-its-mastodon-server-on-december-17th&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; its Mastodon server, Mozilla.social. Even though Mastodon is a decentralized social platform that emphasizes user control, Mozilla’s decision to end its instance means that users who were part of Mozilla.social had to download their data and migrate their connections to another server, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/mozilla-social-faq&quot;&gt;as Mozilla described&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point remains the same: when companies or organizations shut down services, for whatever reason, users risk losing access to posts, messages, and connections unless they take action to save or transfer their data. It’s a reminder of the importance of data portability — and ensuring people can easily move their information to other platforms or services when something like this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while there is (really great) work being done by others, notably the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;, to help retain access to online content, these efforts can’t preserve everything. We can all do our part to help build additional tools and resources to help users transfer data easily, securely, and for any reason — including service shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share Your Feedback and Concerns With Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s navigating tools to back up your content or advocating for better portability standards, we’re committed to putting users in control of their data. We encourage you to visit the Portability Map and let us know how we can improve — and to visit DTI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to explore our other tools, tutorials, and advocacy efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to work with you to help build a future where users can easily move their data across platforms, ensuring that their digital lives remain intact, no matter what happens in the tech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Delara Derakhshani</name></author><category term="social" /><summary type="html">On January 19, TikTok may become unavailable in the United States.

One of my favorites is called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.numlock.com/about&quot;&gt;Numlock News&lt;/a&gt;.” On November 5, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.numlock.com/p/numlock-news-november-5-2024-vape&quot;&gt;their email&lt;/a&gt; shared a statistic that surprised me, although it made sense after I thought about it more. “Last year consumers in the United States returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, which was 14.5 percent of all the things they bought.” That feels like a lot of regret, purchases that didn’t work out as the buyer had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side of regret, in this case, is freedom. We’re more free to make purchases when we know we can return them and get our money back if it doesn’t work out. It’s an even more striking sentiment at this time of year, as we approach the end of year holidays, a season of heavy gift giving. Think about it: how often do you include a gift receipt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the ability to return purchases, we would have less freedom, less creativity, and less experimentation, because we would take fewer chances. This is true both for things we buy for ourselves and for gifts we give to others. Would we buy that bright yellow jacket that looks really great in the store’s lighting, or would we worry it would look like mustard outdoors? Would we decide to get something safe for Aunt Jane instead of that pretty sweater we saw, out of fear she might not like it or it might not fit her perfectly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a similar situation with data transfers. Data portability is valuable because it gives us the freedom to try new things. Want to try out another photo management tool, something that has new kinds of filters or printing tools? You can bring your pictures with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But – what happens when you use that new service for a month, and upload hundreds of new photos to it, then you change your mind and you want to go back? Do you have to re-upload everything? That seems like a lot of work. Enough so that you might hesitate before making the switch in the first place, before trying something with different features or pricing or customer service, just because of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of DTI’s core principles is reciprocity. Reciprocity is about de-risking freedom. If you switch services and you upload more data, you should be able to bring it back with you. Your time and effort shouldn’t be wasted. You should be free to make changes to your digital toolkit, and you should be free to change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data portability has complex normative underpinnings. When it’s viewed from primarily a competition lens, as a policy lever to make sure users aren’t discouraged from moving from larger services to smaller ones, some would argue in favor of an asymmetry. From that perspective, focused narrowly on competitors and market shares, there’s no advantage in a smaller service allowing data exports, no direct impact on market concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s why it’s important to look at policy from the user’s perspective. Even setting aside the data protection components of portability and keeping the focus on competition, it seems likely there will be users who hesitate to try out a new, competitive service. Part of this could be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/11/19/encouraging-public-engagement&quot;&gt;public awareness challenge&lt;/a&gt;, if there are portability options that users aren’t aware of or don’t know how to use. But even the savviest users may fairly worry that anything they do in the new service they’ll have to redo if they change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think back to the retail shopping metaphor. If you could return anything you bought from a major online marketplace, but the cute boutique store down the street had a strict no returns policy, how would that affect your spending habits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all metaphors have their limitations, as does this one. But digital markets are at their healthiest when people both &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, free to try new things. And to the (growing) extent that access to personal data is a key component of the value of online services, reciprocity is a key part of de-risking that critical freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Riley</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">What do retail shopping returns tell us about the importance of reciprocity in data portability?

We help shepherd best-in-class open-source portability tools, build resources like &lt;a href=&quot;https://portmap.dtinit.org/&quot;&gt;Portability Map&lt;/a&gt; to engage broader audiences, and offer our support to stakeholders across the ecosystem working on portability in a variety of respects. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/dti-onepager.pdf&quot;&gt;product and policy principles&lt;/a&gt; articulate what we believe to be necessary to realize our mission of empowering people through a vibrant ecosystem of safe and secure data transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, I’m pleased to share today a new “beta” version of DTI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/docs/TrustModel_Nov2024.pdf&quot;&gt;Trust Model&lt;/a&gt;. Our initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/docs/TrustModelReport.pdf&quot;&gt;Trust Model Report&lt;/a&gt;, released in March of this year, described the role and nature of trust in the context of data portability, and included in its Appendix an initial, high-level trust model. This “v2” model is intended as an expansion and successor to that Appendix. It offers more granular and specific criteria we believe are important for establishing trust in server-to-server data transfers, derived in part from our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/ThreatModel.pdf&quot;&gt;threat model&lt;/a&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the intended use of this model is key to understanding its effects. The model is intended to facilitate information sharing to promote trust and mitigate risk in the context of data portability transactions, rather than serve as a litmus test for the establishment of a relationship or to establish a legal contract. Use of a model and shared terms in this broader context is preferable to the use of independent and unconnected mechanisms, particularly in that it facilitates greater neutrality and consistent application of review. That said, we expect organizations to use this Trust Model within the context of their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few additional considerations for proper use of this model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The model is intended to facilitate trusted relationships for data portability, not to represent compliance or the ability to comply with any laws, including the EU’s Digital Markets Act.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some questions in the model extend beyond regulatory considerations. In this exercise, we chose to err on the side of comprehensiveness, with the intention of global applicability, and in transactions between a wide range of parties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example artifacts listed are *illustrative *examples and are not intended to be exhaustive, or even necessary to address these criteria. In addition, a single artifact (e.g., privacy policy) may apply to multiple criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Context is key in establishing a trust relationship. Answers that suffice for one context may not for another, such as a more sensitive data type.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The goal should not be to ‘score 100%’ on this. The model doesn’t require asking specific questions in any or all circumstances; and it includes no thresholds to establish sufficient trust, as such levels are highly contextual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The model includes questions regarding the jurisdiction and compliance obligations of the transfer parties. These are meant to provide contextual awareness of the practices in place, not judgmental value nor intended to validate legal compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balance is key in all respects. Answers should be as simple and consolidated as possible, such as by providing an established privacy policy. At the same time, there should be room to elaborate and have a dialogue between the transfer parties, where nuance and contextual explanation can help produce trust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relevant risks identified are based upon DTI’s threat/risk model and are not intended to convey a uniform level of risk or any level of risk reduction based on the Trust Model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the significance of the EU’s DMA as a regulatory instrument, data portability is often viewed from that lens, particularly in policy circles. In many ways, EU to EU transfers between parties that are presumed to be in compliance with the GDPR represent the “easy” case for trust. Things like privacy policies are required, and *prima facie *checks with regard to many of the elements of this model should generally be sufficient, at least in the absence of contrary indications of concern. But the internet is global, and transfer parties have global userbases, and a comprehensive trust model designed to be future-proof yet also allow for tailored application in more straightforward situations is more useful than something specifically designed for the EU context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We refer to today’s release as a “beta” product in the sense that we do not consider it to be final. Over the coming weeks, we will incorporate additional input and thinking into a final version, to be released in the spring, as we develop future workstreams to promote trust in the data portability ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/docs/TrustModel_Nov2024.pdf&quot;&gt;Take a look&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/contact-us&quot;&gt;let us know what you think&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Riley</name></author><category term="trust" /><summary type="html">We are publishing in &quot;beta&quot; a more granular Trust Model, building on our prior work.

It was our third, following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/09/10/uk-vision-paper&quot;&gt;UK vision paper&lt;/a&gt; in September and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/06/18/vision-paper&quot;&gt;EU vision paper&lt;/a&gt; in June. One feature common to all three vision papers is that action items to advance data portability aren’t just for governments – there’s room for leadership by any stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to cross-reference DTI’s workstreams with these goals, and get a sense of where we might be able to do more to advance data portability. Through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtinit/data-transfer-project&quot;&gt;DTP tools&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/trust&quot;&gt;trust efforts&lt;/a&gt;, and some ongoing work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2023/10/10/metrics-for-success&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/a&gt;, we’re hitting a lot of the high notes. But one point in the EU vision paper stuck out to me: “Invest in awareness and engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made some investments into broadening awareness of portability. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://portmap.dtinit.org/&quot;&gt;Portability Map&lt;/a&gt; is designed to be a one-stop-shop for the general public to identify tools for transferring their data. But that isn’t the top of the funnel. If people do not think of transferring their data, they’re not going to look for a resource to help them figure out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DTI is still a young organization, and while I’m happy that our email newsletters go to over 1000 people, I don’t imagine that all of those are human beings reading these words with gusto. (Though our open rates are pretty high, and LinkedIn posts always get nice engagement!) If we were to buy ads and encourage people to look at our Portability Map, it probably wouldn’t move any needles. And as much as I enjoy clever brand social media presences, turning DTI into the world’s foremost portability public influencer would reach an always-online crowd who are more likely to be aware than most of the possibilities to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve done a bit of public speaking and a little event organizing, and we’ll continue to do that. From a resources and audience perspective, we tend to focus that work on audiences that have a baseline of awareness, which means communities in political capitals – DC, Brussels, London – and tech hubs. While that can help us translate all of our workstreams into significant impact, it doesn’t do as much for public engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events that are one circle out from our core communities are a possibility. If data portability reaches a stage like the Consumer Electronics Show or South by Southwest, that would likely open some new eyes, and doors. It’s a space worth exploring more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger audiences care about a broad range of issues, but as we highlighted in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/11/05/us-vision-paper&quot;&gt;US vision paper&lt;/a&gt;, data portability matters for more than just its own sake – it factors into competition, innovation, online safety, and AI governance. Building up both the intellectual and the technical connections among these issues will help. We’re doing that with AI, for example, through some supported &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/DTI-Data-Portability-Compendium.pdf&quot;&gt;scholarship&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/08/26/inflection-AI-portability&quot;&gt;collaborations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validators help, if they’re the right ones. Someday a YouTuber or podcaster who speaks on tech issues to a large audience will get excited about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/08/27/DTI-members-new-music-tool&quot;&gt;transferring their playlists&lt;/a&gt; and walk through the experience live. Real world use helps bring home the value of data portability, more than any amount of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the internet itself will help more in the future. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/&quot;&gt;Anil Dash wrote&lt;/a&gt; last year that “the Internet is about to get weird again.” When people want to experiment with their tech, when they move from complacence to an interest in discovery, they’ll find that they often want, or need, to bring data they’ve contributed with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forcing people to take action can’t be the goal. If people are happy with what they’ve got, they shouldn’t have to lose that. But it seems possible, even likely, that a lack of public awareness is limiting the value of data portability – that there are people who feel stuck when they need not be, people who have never heard of the term “data portability.” We don’t really have the right data to know the extent of such a sentiment, at this point. That, I think, is a solvable problem, and something we could explore in the future, conducting surveys with the right sort of organizational partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’m certain of is that data portability has a tremendously high ceiling of impact. But if people aren’t aware or aren’t given good reason to engage with it, it’ll never show its potential in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have ideas on how we can tackle this?

The United States is, and will continue to be, a critically important environment to realize DTI’s mission. Today we are sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/DTIvisionpaperUS.pdf&quot;&gt;our vision&lt;/a&gt; for this context, including why data portability is important in the U.S., and what can be done to advance the benefits of portability for the internet ecosystem and all of its participant organizations and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the regulation concerning data portability has been outside the United States, but there has been some activity. Last year, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/dti-leglandscape.pdf&quot;&gt;analyzed legislative proposals&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and compared them to portability rules in the European Union, specifically the GDPR and the Digital Markets Act. Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/10/08/global-policy-round-up&quot;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2023/10/24/global-developments&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, DTI also highlighted the portability provisions of newly passed U.S. state privacy laws and provided global policy updates, noting a trend towards more regulation on the issue. Certainly, future U.S. action could meaningfully change the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But laws are just a piece of the puzzle of data portability, neither necessary nor sufficient in and of themselves to realize benefit. And the benefits of portability are significant. Its origins are in data protection, and recently many analysts have focused on its relation to competition. Even these significant domains do not tell the full story of data portability’s impact, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/DTIvisionpaperUS.pdf&quot;&gt;U.S. vision paper&lt;/a&gt;, we articulate the broad range of benefits that user-driven data portability helps provide, including innovation, user agency, online safety, and AI governance. Data portability is not meant to be a complete answer to any of these, but it offers significant and sustainable positive impact towards them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also offer a roadmap to realize the benefits of data portability in the U.S., one that can be led by the U.S. government or by non-governmental actors, though it will ultimately require collaboration from a broad range of leaders. The action items on that roadmap are to raise public awareness; convene stakeholders; develop metrics; invest in innovation; promote compliance; and collaborate globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As data portability becomes more central in policy discussions, U.S. stakeholders, both in and out of government, have a rare opportunity to come together and provide tangible and universal benefit, not only for the country but for the world. At DTI, we will do our part, leading and bringing stakeholders together to advance our mission: empowering people by building a vibrant ecosystem for simple and secure data transfers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Riley</name></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html">The U.S. has a long history as a leader in technology policy.

&lt;p&gt;Because of this origin story, we’ve focused mostly on how data sharing works in the cloud. But we also think that how data sharing works on devices is both instructive and is part of a system that should be considered holistically. To be able to deliver on our mission, it’s critical for us to understand the context in which it operates. That’s perhaps most visible when we work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/10/08/global-policy-round-up&quot;&gt;public policy&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s true in all our efforts. For example, we looked at other kinds of registries when beginning to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/07/30/trust-work-updates&quot;&gt;our own trust work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article considers how DTI’s focus, cloud-based portability, relates to device-based portability - focusing on technologies for access and authentication, and on the nature and mechanisms of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-cloud&quot;&gt;In the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology context for accessing personal data in the cloud is mostly HTTP-based:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data requests are almost always HTTP requests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authenticating the user happens with a login Web page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideally, any time sensitive personal data is involved and login happens by username/password, the password page is followed by a two-factor verification or one-time password confirmation (again sent via HTTP requests)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every single HTTP data request by the user after login needs to be securely associated with a session, through a session token that links to the user, because HTTP is technically a “stateless” protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data access requests from other parties also happen over stateless HTTP. It’s challenging to associate one session key with another session’s authorization choices in a stateless protocol that does nothing to link these individual HTTP requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud services don’t always offer the ability to share personal data with 3rd parties. Sometimes when users really want to share data between services, they share their service password (and sometimes even a one-time-password configuration!) with a 3rd party. Now the 3rd party is authorized as the user, using a session token that isn’t really distinguishable from one of the user’s normal session tokens that keep them logged in. Because the 3rd party is not distinguishable from the real user in any reliable way, we don’t consider this data access - it is really &lt;em&gt;identity access&lt;/em&gt;, and leaves the user open to many possible abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there are systems in place to allow 3rd-party access &lt;em&gt;authorized by&lt;/em&gt; the user but not &lt;em&gt;authenticating as&lt;/em&gt; the user, this is occasionally solved with &lt;a href=&quot;https://oauth.net/2/&quot;&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; but often solved by the service using a non-standard process (including, for example, a developer program with statically issued API keys, and configuration/settings data to know if each user authorized the 3rd party). Solutions for consent UX and consent management are not widely standardized, interoperable or reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-the-device&quot;&gt;On the Device&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern device platforms went through an early, fast and comprehensive process of designing data access Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in order to enable many exciting applications to be installed and make the devices more useful. Personal data access is much more ubiquitous and consistent on devices, as compared to the diverse access offerings of independent online services (some very small) which hold personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used APIs today are the Swift and Objective-C APIs on iOS, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/&quot;&gt;Android Platform APIs&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices. Data requests through these APIs are always local to the device: there needs to be an installed app on the device to request the data from the OS on the device. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The user unlocks their device using a passcode, facial recognition or fingerprint. Once the device is unlocked, almost all choices are considered authorized. Some sensitive operations might prompt another identity check, returning to the unlocked state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While the phone is unlocked, application data requests happen inside the user’s “session.” There’s no need to re-login the user.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data access requests to the platform API either come from apps that were developed by the platform company, or from apps which the user decided to install - another mark of trust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For security, apps are prevented from full access to all the data held by the device through sandboxing - limiting access to only data types or collections that have been granted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a data request is made from an application through the API to the part of the OS holding data, it’s good modern practice to prompt the user for consent. Many data access requests are made while the user is actively interacting with the app, and the user can consent or deny immediately when a popup asks them to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consent can later be reviewed and revoked by the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these device-context data access requests involve HTTP or OAuth. So among other distinctions, authentication, authorization and revocation solutions all must be completely different technology compared to cloud solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consistency-of-trust-criteria&quot;&gt;Consistency of Trust Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both device and cloud environments limit nearly all platform-mediated user-requested transfer of personal data to 3rd parties that the platform has “verified” or given an API key to. Such limitations can be an important part of protecting users from legitimate-seeming data requests that aren’t really legitimate, or of protecting the cloud platform from Denial-of-Service attacks and other Internet abuses (or both reasons, or more reasons). Whatever the reason for establishing these verification or access programs, the result is that only approved 3rd parties get meaningful access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all &lt;em&gt;Trust Lists&lt;/em&gt;, and they all involve &lt;em&gt;Trust Criteria&lt;/em&gt;,** **even if different companies use different terms such as telling 3rd parties to apply to a “developer program” or “add-on marketplace.” Although they may serve several purposes, including explicitly limiting some uses of data received via the APIs, one avowed purpose is to protect the user from granting access to a 3rd party that is likely to put personal data at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part because of the conflicting needs being served by these lists, some of these trust lists are run in very arbitrary ways. In 2023, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/29/twitter-announces-new-api-with-only-free-basic-and-enterprise-levels/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (now X) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/04/reddit-braces-for-life-after-api-changes/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; drastically cut back on API access. In both cases, they at least initially cut off apps used to help individuals with accessibility needs, to moderate harmful content, and to do public-interest research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms with broad functionality may evaluate the same 3rd party in different ways internally. The same startup with an app in a mobile app marketplace may also apply for access to the same company’s cloud data APIs. Should we expect a 3rd party to be approved across the board, or must they apply in each context? How should trust renewal in the cloud impact consent given on devices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of a poor outcome due to inconsistency: a startup gets their app approved for installation on my device, and I choose to install it and consent to data access. The same startup applies for cloud data API access (to the same large platform OR to another platform I’ve synched the same data to), in a process that requires them to provide their updated SOC2 report annually. One day, that startup gets bought by another company and stops providing their SOC2 report. Without a holistic view of the system, that startup is likely to continue getting my data via the app I installed on my phone, even as their access to cloud data is cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a fun system from the perspective of the startup, either. A startup can work hard on its business plan and software, but still have severe “unknowns” in getting approval for data access. The risk and effort required increase with the number of inconsistent trust lists and trust criteria, making the startup have to painfully choose which things to cut from their plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing our privacy and data access authorizations can only work smoothly if we are able to apply consistent choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I trust a “FamilyShare” service with my photos on the device, I should be able to consent to their access to the same data in the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If my consent for “FamilyShare” access expires in 6 months in the cloud or I’m prompted to renew, the same expiration should be the default on my device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If “FamilyShare” loses its trusted status due to violation of its own terms or repeated data breaches, that organization should lose trust and access on devices as well as in the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing best-practices between device and cloud environments makes sense even when they’re completely independent. UX researchers who look at both environments can spread those best practices. However, to maximally benefit the user’s experience, we need to go further than just best practices and look at consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t divide up their technology use into the clean boxes that programmers and protocol designers might prefer to have. Consent and trust are issues that cut across the technology silos, as they must.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lisa Dusseault</name></author><category term="trust" /><summary type="html">Our focus is on data portability between cloud-based services, which has technical differences from other kinds of access.

Previously, we wrote on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/05/07/portability-federal-law&quot;&gt;data portability language in U.S. federal law&lt;/a&gt; and provided an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2023/10/24/global-developments&quot;&gt;overview of the global landscape&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few new updates on where things stand around the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe and the UK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2023/06/06/complex-problem-space&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; before, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in Europe introduced some novel elements to data portability, and despite taking effect in March of this year, significant questions around its implementation remain unresolved. Meanwhile, for some time now, regulators around the world continue to adopt their own take on Europe’s GDPR data portability requirements, and now have new sources of European inspiration in both the DMA and the EU’s Data Act and Data Governance Act as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/09/10/uk-vision-paper&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about the United Kingdom, where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453&quot;&gt;Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act 2024&lt;/a&gt; (DMCC) has been adopted (although its implementation still lies ahead). While the DMCC does not include specific data portability obligations, its broader themes of empowering people, expanding markets, and creating opportunities for digital economy growth are certainly relevant to DTI’s work in data portability. And as we have detailed in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/DTIvisionpaperUK.pdf&quot;&gt;vision for the UK&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/creating-a-smart-data-economy&quot;&gt;Smart Data agenda&lt;/a&gt; also has implications for secure data transfers in the digital sector and its impact on the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Jurisdictions Recognize a Right to Portability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malaysia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, a set of new privacy protections—including the right to portability—passed as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://f.datasrvr.com/fr1/224/81715/DR_21_BI.pdf&quot;&gt;a bill to amend Malaysia’s existing privacy law&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pdp.gov.my/ppdpv1/akta/akta-pdp-2010/&quot;&gt;2010 Personal Data Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;. The new data portability right requires electronic notice and is subject to “technical feasibility and compatibility of the data format.” On September 6, Malaysia concluded a public consultation period on how best to implement the new privacy protections. The country’s Personal Data Protection Department (PDPD) asked questions about the appropriate scope of data portability requests as well as difficulties associated with responding to requests. In doing so, the PDPD appeared to signal an understanding of the challenges associated with technical interoperability, while considering the extent to which data portability requests should be honored even in the face of technical challenges. The Digital Minister of Malaysia has noted that several guidelines are being developed to accompany the new laws and we expect that the public will gain insight into any new data portability guidelines in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new data portability right went into effect in Québec on September 22, making it the first and only jurisdiction in Canada to require data portability. The right was part of a set of amendments (known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/Fichiers_client/lois_et_reglements/LoisAnnuelles/en/2021/2021C25A.PDF&quot;&gt;Law 25&lt;/a&gt;”) to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/p-39.1&quot;&gt;Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Barring “serious practical difficulties” (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, complexity of practical procedures and high costs) individuals can request their computerized personal information from organizations in a “structured, commonly used technological format.” They can also ask organizations to transfer this information “to any person or body authorized by law to collect such information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In associated guidance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cai.gouv.qc.ca/protection-renseignements-personnels/information-entreprises-privees/responsable-protection-renseignements-personnels-entreprise#portabilite&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quebec.ca/gouvernement/travailler-gouvernement/travailler-fonction-publique/services-employes-etat/conformite/protection-des-renseignements-personnels/acces-aux-renseignements-personnels/droit-portabilite&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the government of Québec acknowledges that while the implementation of interoperable systems is not a legal requirement, it does facilitate smooth and efficient transfers in a way that allows users to fully benefit from their right to portability. The guidance notes that the right to data portability encompasses both data provided &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; and data provided &lt;em&gt;indirectly&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, generated through a user’s activity)—but that it excludes certain information from the data portability right, including “personal information created or inferred,” noting the example of a user profile created from the analysis of his or her web activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance leaves room for future changes, noting that a “public body” may specify additional clarifications to the right to data portability in the future—including the information covered by the right and the procedure to follow a request. Finally, the guidance also recognizes an important distinction between the right to access data and the right to data portability (a point that is sometimes overlooked or left vague) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-contenu.quebec.ca/cdn-contenu/adm/min/conseil-executif/publications-adm/sridail/protection-renseignements-personnels/Distinction_droit_acces_droit_portabilite.pdf&quot;&gt;lays out the differences&lt;/a&gt; between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. State Privacy Laws&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, states continue to pass privacy laws with a right to data portability. In 2024, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/recorddocuments/bill/24RS/hb15/bill.pdf&quot;&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/Chapters_noln/CH_455_sb0541e.pdf&quot;&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF4757&amp;amp;type=bill&amp;amp;version=4&amp;amp;session=ls93&amp;amp;session_year=2024&amp;amp;session_number=0&quot;&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/108/PDF/Slip/LB1074.pdf&quot;&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=26608&amp;amp;q=billVersion&quot;&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2022/PL23/266_.PDF&quot;&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText24/HouseText24/H7787A.htm&quot;&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; passed privacy laws; every single one of them includes a general right to data portability. The states generally follow the same formula. In general, their purpose is to allow consumers to easily transmit data to another entity (or “without hindrance,” as phrased in the laws). The laws also recognize that there should be some limits to when and how data portability should be required. This is a stance that DTI strongly agrees with. In general, the data has to concern the individual and the request must be honored if “technically feasible” (although Kentucky has chosen to adopt the phrase “technically practicable,” which, while undefined, could be interpreted as requiring a lower bar for when companies can refuse to port users’ data). Most of the states (Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Rhode Island) explicitly mention revealing trade secrets as an exception to data portability, further recognizing that there is a limit to what is required under the right and suggesting that there is an important difference between data about a user and proprietary information and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sector-Specific Laws&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some countries continue to adopt a sector-specific approach to portability, focusing generally on either health data or open banking. While DTI is focused on data portability as it applies more generally—there are certainly important considerations and parallels to our work in these sector-specific laws and rulemakings that are worth tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is reportedly close to releasing its open banking rules based on Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules are related to the data portability and interoperability of personal financial data rights and were initially proposed and presented to the public for comment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-jumpstart-competition-and-accelerate-shift-to-open-banking/&quot;&gt;October 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Among issues the CFPB solicited comment on were obligations for third parties accessing a consumer’s data—including important privacy protections for that data—and how to develop standards that provide fair, open, and inclusive access to data. The CFPB is expected to finalize and release its final open banking rules in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While DTI’s work isn’t generally to engage in advocacy, we do seek to be a resource to policymakers around the world, particularly as they look to the implementation phase to turn laws like these into practice. We will continue to track global developments and look forward to opportunities to add value with our expertise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Delara Derakhshani</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">Sharing some updates on data portability and related laws around the world.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Data spaces and data portability</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/24/spaces-portability" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Data spaces and data portability" /><published>2024-09-24T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2024-09-24T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/24/spaces-portability</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/24/spaces-portability">&lt;p&gt;One of the cornerstones of the European Union’s data strategy is a substantial investment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces&quot;&gt;European data spaces&lt;/a&gt;. But what, exactly, is a “data space”? And how does this effort relate to data portability and the work that DTI is doing? While the goals and infrastructure models between data spaces and data portability differ in some respects, the values motivating them have a good amount of overlap, as do some of the tools and experience that will be needed to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About data spaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a data space is typically framed around a subject, such as a data space for the energy sector, agriculture, or for health data. Digital data relevant to any of these topics can support significant value creation to users. If a business is building, say, a smart energy tool designed to help users reduce their monthly bills, it’s helpful if both the tool providers and end-users are able to access data from a variety of providers on prices and fees. Other stakeholders can benefit from the existence of a data space, including government agencies and businesses in that sector, but it requires investment to achieve interoperability, fairness, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sense in which the data is gathered in a “space” is mostly conceptual. It’s not literally housed in one data store or data warehouse. Data is generated by a diverse range of sources and managed by a diverse range of actors, and any attempt to centralize all data within a single sector in a single controlled digital storage would be horribly fragile and would not be conducive to effective use by businesses or people nor to innovation. Instead, the data space concept recognizes that data on energy prices and data on energy usage, for example, are more closely related than they are far apart. An agent that uses one kind of energy data is more likely to produce or consume another kind of energy data, so the schema and trust work can be leveraged for both kinds of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some data in a data space may be collected in a centralized data store to a certain extent. An intermediary, such as one described in the EU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act-explained&quot;&gt;Data Governance Act&lt;/a&gt;, might collect data from a large number of sources. It can provide important consistency, anonymization and aggregation functions, allowing more value to be derived from inconsistent data sources or simply to reduce privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The forces behind data spaces and related frames&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU is funding work on data spaces through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme&quot;&gt;Digital Europe Programme&lt;/a&gt;. Organizations such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus-x.org/&quot;&gt;Prometheus-X&lt;/a&gt; are built in part on this funding, and are developing shared trust frameworks. In the EU, trust frameworks must be mutli-layered, allowing member nations to make their own determinations of which regulators can attest to the trust status of industry participants, while still allowing pan-EU trust questions to be answered and cross-border interoperability to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source software is not neglected in the policy and regulatory work, although open source licenses by themselves are no guarantee of trust or interoperability. The EU uses the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/simpl&quot;&gt;Simpl&lt;/a&gt; to describe its intention to build open-source tools to facilitate data transfers within its data spaces framework; a consortium of European organizations &lt;a href=&quot;https://eviden.com/insights/news/eviden-leads-consortium-to-provide-simpl-open-oss-data-spaces-middleware-to-the-european-commission/&quot;&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it had won the bidding to build the Simpl “middleware” platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many stakeholders in the United Kingdom are participating in the same data space concepts but additionally in a couple other architectures. For example, the proposed General Data Exchange Layer, as articulated by Jon Nash in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicfirst.co.uk/rewiring-the-state.html&quot;&gt;Rewiring the State - Public First&lt;/a&gt;, describes a future where the United Kingdom’s Department for Work and Pensions can, “with one click,” gather information from a range of companies and public sector agencies to determine an individual’s eligibility for benefits. In many cases, the data subject (citizen, resident or business) would approve the data request but then not have to actually fill out the data – instead some other entity that already has the needed data can with that approval satisfy the request. Data request routing, approval, and response automation would significantly reduce paperwork and can if carefully managed reduce fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly the UK has invested significantly in the concept of Smart Data, led by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66190f98679e9c8d921dfe44/smart-data-roadmap-action-the-government-is-taking-in-2024-to-2025.pdf&quot;&gt;Department of Business and Trade&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its recent change of government, the issue remains alive, having been highlighted in the King’s Speech. DTI just returned from London, in fact, where we sponsored and contributed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartdataforum.org/&quot;&gt;Smart Data Forum&lt;/a&gt;. The Department for Business and Trade within the UK government defines smart data as “the secure sharing of customer data with authorized third parties (ATPs).” Of course, that language articulates only the first step of the overall puzzle, and the Smart Data agenda is much broader. The UK is designing funding and a number of other strategies to advance this vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, the OECD also appears to be exploring interventions in this space, as it &lt;a href=&quot;https://mydata.org/2024/05/29/mydata-goes-to-brussels/&quot;&gt;runs a consultation through 2024&lt;/a&gt; on the concept of “trusted data intermediaries;” the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydata.org/&quot;&gt;MyData&lt;/a&gt; organization and community – itself oriented towards many intersecting goals – is providing a supporting role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How our work at DTI fits into the picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these efforts share a lot with the effort to improve data portability, where DTI is most active. In all of these problem spaces, &lt;strong&gt;shared formats&lt;/strong&gt; are crucial to make data accessible and avoid translation errors. &lt;strong&gt;Trust&lt;/strong&gt; is paramount, ensuring that the senders and receivers of data can trust each other, and that the subject of the data where applicable is authorizing the transfer. An important concept is the ability to bootstrap through &lt;strong&gt;discovery,&lt;/strong&gt; so that stakeholders can hope to learn who has the data they need, at what Internet address, and what procedure to use to access the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can DTI’s work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtinit/data-transfer-project&quot;&gt;Data Transfer Project&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/trust&quot;&gt;a trust framework&lt;/a&gt; be considered part of data spaces in the broadest sense? We have collaborated with several of the aforementioned projects, but to call our work “data spaces” would be to blur our scope and complicate our requirements. Language is imprecise and we need to make sure not to overgeneralize simply based on using similar language. Both a railway flatcar and an Olympic shot putter are mechanisms that transfer iron from one location to another but the physical differences are so obvious we wouldn’t try to unify those both under a “metal transport” solution. We call user data “data” when we generalize but it’s often more accurately called “content”, and user content such as email, photos or social media posts are not the subject of any existing data spaces (though rates of photo uploads, magnitudes of social media activity, moderation or harmful content rates and other activity data around content might sooner be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, personal data transfer is simpler. There are fewer parties involved in personal data transfer – only the user, the source for their data and the destination. In data spaces, the data flows of an entire industry include data that is public as well as private, as well as data that is proprietary to businesses. The data flows of an entire industry can originate in many more places, can involve multilayer trust relationships, and multi-step data translations, transfers and aggregations. In other ways the personal data transfer requirements are more demanding, because our use cases always involve user consent or initiation and privacy concerns, whereas often data spaces involve sharing non-personal data such as government data, business data and aggregated anonymized consumer data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could personal data transfer be included under the large umbrella of data spaces work anyway, to achieve unification, at least when the personal data transfer relates to a topic of a data space (such as how personal retail activity is data that a user might want to download or transfer, but also part of retail supply chain data as a whole)? Certainly in some cases, but such an approach might come with unacceptable delay in arriving at solutions. Engineers know that trying to solve too many problems at once can result in untamable complexity. Consider the complexity of Gaia-X’s specifications for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gaia-x.eu/technical-committee/data-exchange/23.11/dewg/&quot;&gt;data exchange services&lt;/a&gt;, for example. This complexity may be appropriate to the outcome of boosting the effectiveness of an entire industry, but it might be overkill for simply allowing a user to transfer their calendar from one service to another. We can work on these smaller simpler standalone features and gain the benefit of making the solutions available more quickly to users while at the same time opening doors to competitiveness and innovation even from small startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking to the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately some of this work may converge anyway, and in the meantime we can share expertise at a high level because these efforts are complementary. In addition to exchanging notes on governance and trust models, we can share experience with schema specifics and detailed use cases. I hope and expect that we will align strategies where we can, to better shape together and measure the impact of these efforts for our global digital future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Riley</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">DTI’s work on data portability relates to work on Smart Data and data spaces; but there are distinctions in the contexts worth a deeper look.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">DTI’s UK tech policy vision</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/10/uk-vision-paper" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DTI’s UK tech policy vision" /><published>2024-09-10T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2024-09-10T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/10/uk-vision-paper</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/10/uk-vision-paper">&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom is at a pivotal moment on its technology regulatory journey. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453&quot;&gt;Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act&lt;/a&gt; has been adopted, but its implementation lies ahead, as does a potential future &lt;a href=&quot;https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430&quot;&gt;Data Protection and Digital Information Bill&lt;/a&gt;, alongside next steps for Smart Data initiatives. At the intersection of competition, data protection, and smart data lies an opportunity for leadership: by empowering users and UK businesses alike through effective data portability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, we shared a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/06/18/vision-paper&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; for the future of tech policy in the European Union, powered by data portability. That vision built upon the EU’s regulatory landscape and offered five opportunities for European leadership to promote a future of effective digital rights and digital freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we offer a comparable, and compatible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtinit.org/assets/DTIvisionpaperUK.pdf&quot;&gt;vision for the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, articulating data portability’s benefits for &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt;, a key goal for the new government. Grounded in the core values of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6697f5c10808eaf43b50d18e/The_King_s_Speech_2024_background_briefing_notes.pdf&quot;&gt;King’s Speech&lt;/a&gt; – security, fairness, and opportunity for all – DTI identifies four priorities for the UK to grow its digital economy: (1) promote portability; (2) keep users at the center; (3) measure true impact; and (4) reward openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Channel, across the Atlantic, and around the world, data portability is rising in salience in policy and industry circles alike. Engagement from key governments and businesses is both opportune and growing. At DTI, we will continue to lead and bring stakeholders together to deliver growth by advancing our mission: empowering people by building a vibrant ecosystem for simple and secure data transfers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Riley</name></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html">DTI offers a vision for growth in the UK digital sector, powered by data portability.</summary></entry></feed>
