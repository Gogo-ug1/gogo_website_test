<h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    The Data Transfer Initiative is an independent nonprofit organization that works closely with partner organizations, collaborators, and others to achieve our mission of providing simpler, faster, more efficient data portability tools for users at scale. We take the privacy of our users extremely seriously. Below, we have laid out in this Privacy Policy the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the steps we take to protect your privacy.
  </p>
  <p>At DTI, we will not collect, retain, use, or disclose personal information for any purpose other than those described in this Policy. We will not collect more information than is needed to accomplish the purposes described in this Policy, and will not retain any information collected longer than is necessary to fulfill those purposes.</p>

<h3>Scope of Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
This Privacy Policy covers the DTI Website. DTI actively uses social media and other platforms to engage with the public and advance our work. Those pages are governed by each platform’s respective privacy policy.
</p>

<h3>Information You Provide Us</h3>
<p>
To offer our guests certain features on our websites, we may collect several types of personal information when you use and interact with our websites. You may provide personal information to us directly to: (1) allow us to respond to requests to contact us, (2) sign up to receive newsletters, (3) register for and participate in our conferences or other events. This information may include: name, e-mail address, employer, and other information you provide to us, including user feedback. If you choose to contact us via our website or social media, we will not use the information for any purpose other than to respond to your inquiry or to act upon your suggestion or comment. We will not share your information with others except with your permission or upon your request.
</p>

<h3>Email addresses</h3>
<p>
Our newsletter subscribers’ email addresses are stored in an online database. We use these addresses to send newsletters, blog posts, and announcements about upcoming events, which subscribers can opt out of. We also reserve the right to use these addresses to contact our subscribers at other times.
</p> 

<h3>Website transactions</h3>
<p>
When a visitor requests pages at our site, the server automatically recognizes the visitor’s public IP address. The server may collect this and other basic internet capability information in order to aggregate information on what pages users access or visit. This information may be used for statistical and operational purposes. We do not combine your IP address with any other personal information. Visitors should be advised that DTI’s website links to other sites, each of which is beyond DTI’s control. Because of the nature of the Internet, DTI cannot be responsible for the content or privacy policies of the websites to which it links.
</p>

<h3>Children and Minors</h3>
<p>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 and minors under the age of 18.  We take kids’ privacy seriously, and we encourage parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their child’s personal information, they should contact us at info@dtinit.org to request the deletion of the information. While DTI’s content is appropriate for most audiences, we do not knowingly market our website or other materials to children. If DTI discovers it inadvertently has information about a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
Our Websites also use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.  Cookies are pieces of information that a Website sends to your computer while you are viewing the Website.  We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.  For example, when you return to one of our Websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the Website so that the Website will remember you.  You may be able to choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to turn off all cookies.  You can do this through your web browser settings.  Each browser is a little different, so consult your browser’s help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. We aim to provide information and services even if you turn off cookies.

         <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We will comply with lawful requests from government agencies that follow appropriate legal standards and procedures.
