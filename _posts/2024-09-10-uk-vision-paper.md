The United Kingdom is at a pivotal moment on its technology regulatory journey. The [Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453) has been adopted, but its implementation lies ahead, as does a potential future [Data Protection and Digital Information Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430), alongside next steps for Smart Data initiatives. At the intersection of competition, data protection, and smart data lies an opportunity for leadership: by empowering users and UK businesses alike through effective data portability.

In June, we shared a [vision](https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/06/18/vision-paper) for the future of tech policy in the European Union, powered by data portability. That vision built upon the EU’s regulatory landscape and offered five opportunities for European leadership to promote a future of effective digital rights and digital freedoms.

Today we offer a comparable, and compatible, [vision for the United Kingdom](https://dtinit.org/assets/DTIvisionpaperUK.pdf), articulating data portability’s benefits for **growth**, a key goal for the new government. Grounded in the core values of the [King’s Speech](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6697f5c10808eaf43b50d18e/The_King_s_Speech_2024_background_briefing_notes.pdf) – security, fairness, and opportunity for all – DTI identifies four priorities for the UK to grow its digital economy: (1) promote portability; (2) keep users at the center; (3) measure true impact; and (4) reward openness.

Across the Channel, across the Atlantic, and around the world, data portability is rising in salience in policy and industry circles alike. Engagement from key governments and businesses is both opportune and growing. At DTI, we will continue to lead and bring stakeholders together to deliver growth by advancing our mission: empowering people by building a vibrant ecosystem for simple and secure data transfers.
